            <p> <i> "If you want something fixed, it'd be faster to do it yourself"</i></p>

            <p> It's easy to complain about design and usability of an app when you're the end-user, 
                so I wondered what it's like to look at from the other side. At Stony Brook University,
                my Organic Chemistry professor made his own web-app to handle all homework, tests and problems
                students learn about throughout many different courses. Despite that, there always seems to 
                be something 'missing', something the script isn't designed to do and hinders progression.
                I wondered what it'd be like to make my own version of this web-app, Oscer, and if I could
                improve upon the inconveniences that come with it. Eos is my take on organic synthesis and all
                the annoyances that come with it. </br>
                Sufficient to say, Dr. Lauer deserves far more credit than he's been given.

                 to make them. To see the latest public version of Eos,</br>
